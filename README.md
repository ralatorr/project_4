# Evaluating the Effects of Air Quality on Health Outcomes Amongst CA Counties
---

# Problem Statement

Pollution has long been known to have a causal effect on negative health outcomes. Our group's goal was to use various statistical hypothesis tests as well as exploratory data analysis and regression analysis to gain a stronger quantitative understanding of the effects of air pollution amongst the 58 counties of California. 

# Background

### EPA Air Quality Data 

Our primary data source and point of departure for all subsequent analysis is EPA air quality data. The EPA monitors and collects data on air pollution in every major city in United States. The air quality data is aggregated in varying levels of granularity. From this collection process, the EPA calculates the Air Quality Index, a measurement of overall danger to health that ranges from 0 (none) to 500 (maximum danger) The AQI is calculated by taking the highest average measurement of each of the constituent pollution factors being monitored, and weighs it by known health effects. 

At the more coarse annual level, we find our chosen dataset: the aggregate level of monitored pollutants, per day, for each County in the United States. 

We collected and cleaned this data from the EPA's website [[SOURCE](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Annual)]. The major air quality metrics monitored are:

1. Days NO2 - Nitrogen Dioxide, very similar to Nitrogen Oxide (NOx). The primary source of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide is the burning of fossil fuels. 

2. Days Ozone - While stratospheric ozone is known to be a good thing due to its blocking of harmful ultraviolet radiation, ground-level ozone has been found to cause a number of health problems. 

3. Days PM2.5 - Fine particulate matter with a diameter 2.5 micrometers or smaller. This matter often emanates from dust stirred up from a construction site or field, or incomplete combustion (smoke) from smoke stacks or a forest fire. PM 2.5 particulate matter is often associated with haze, and, when inhaled, embeds deep in the lungs. 

4. Days PM10 - Coarse particulate matter. Also emanating from dust producing sources as well as incomplete combustion (smoke).

5. Days CO - Carbon Monoxide. Produced by the combustion of fossil fuels and causes a number of lung ailments from fatigue through death.

Exposure to these particulates has been found to lead to negative cardiovascular, respiratory health outcomes as well as increased incidence rates of various cancers. 

# Summary

We chose to evaluate the effects toxic air pollution on three health outcomes, mortality, low birth weight and cancer incidence.
